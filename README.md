This repository was created as part of my studies at **[RS School](https://rs.school/) (2024–2025)** within the **JavaScript / Front-End Development Course**.

It contains several educational projects developed during the course, demonstrating my progress in frontend development, working with modern tools, and building interactive web applications.
